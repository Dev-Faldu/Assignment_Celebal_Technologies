`<details><summary>Click to Expand</summary>`

1. When should we prefer `tuple` over `list` in real-world use cases?
2. Are Python `dicts` always ordered in versions >= 3.7?
3. Any internal Python linting or formatting tools (e.g., `black`, `flake8`)?
4. Best practices for loading data from `.csv` or `.json` in large pipelines?
5. How should we document functions and modules at Celebal (docstring standards)?
